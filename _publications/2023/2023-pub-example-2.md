  We propose the Rescaled Pure Greedy Learning Algorithm (RPGLA) for solving the kernel-based regression problem. The computational complexity of the RPGLA is less than the Orthogonal Greedy Learning Algorithm (OGLA) and Relaxed Greedy Learning Algorithm (RGLA), and the convergence rate can be arbitrarily close to the best rate under a mild assumption of the regression function.
