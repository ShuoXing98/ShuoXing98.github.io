  In this paper, we initiate the study of the Fair Submodular Cover Problem (FSC). Given a ground set $U$, a monotone submodular function $f:2^U\to\mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}$, and a threshold $\tau$, the goal of FSC is to find a balanced subset of $U$ with minimum cardinality such that $f(S)\ge\tau$. We first introduce discrete algorithms for FSC that achieve a bicriteria approximation ratio of $(\frac{1}{\varepsilon}, 1-O(\varepsilon))$. We then present a continuous algorithm that achieves a $(\ln\frac{1}{\varepsilon}, 1-O(\varepsilon))$-bicriteria approximation ratio, which matches the best approximation guarantee of submodular cover without a fairness constraint.
